              I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed developer who specializes in full
              stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic
              about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital
              products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and
              writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me. I
              began my journey as a web developer in 2023, and since then, I've
              continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
              challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
              Now, in my early thirties, 2 years after starting my web
              development journey,I am very much a progressive
              thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation
              all the way to development.Finally, some quick bits about me. B.S. in Software Engineering,
              Avid learner, Full-time freelancer. One last
              thing, I'm available for freelance work, so feel free to reach out
              and say hello! I promise I don't bite ðŸ˜‰
